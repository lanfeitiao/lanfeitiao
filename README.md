🔁 I made the jump from NGO research and education into software and data science

🎓 Currently studying at Codam College in the Netherlands, gaining a solid foundation in CS through project-based work in C and C++

🧠 Previously trained in Statistics (Sun Yat-sen University & Peking University, China) and Migration Studies (Oxford University, UK)

🛠 Most motivated by building tools through software and AI that address real-world needs and support social good

🌍 Curious by nature — whether through coding, cooking, traveling or finding new ways to learn and create
