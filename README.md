# Hi 👋🏼, I'm Jiani!

🔁 I made the jump from NGO research and co-founding an edtech startup into software and data science

🎓 Studying at Codam College in Amsterdam, gaining a solid foundation in CS through project-based work in C and C++

🧠 Previously trained in Statistics (Sun Yat-sen University & Peking University, China) and Migration Studies (Oxford University, UK)

🛠 Most motivated by building tools through software and AI that address real-world needs and support social good

🌍 Curious by nature — whether through coding, cooking, traveling or finding new ways to learn and create

🧑‍💻 Currently exploring LLMs and building a Dutch learning app for international parents like me
